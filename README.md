# Recommendify

# Description & Inspiration 
I got bored of listening to the same songs over and over again. Spotify has a really great recommendation system, and I was curious to learn more about it. Fast-forward to 
me traversing through their Web-API, I came across /api/v1/recommendations, an endpoint which generates song recommendations based on song metadata, artists, other tracks, etc. 
I never knew Spotify kept track of a song's acousticeness, danceability, liveness, etc, and I didn't see the option to fine tune recommendations on their actual app based on song data. That's 
how Recommendify was born. With this app, users can select artists and fine tine a wide-range of song metadata to find similar songs, preview them, and add them to a playlist!
